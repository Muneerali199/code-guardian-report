# 🧪 Real Analysis Testing Guide

## How to Verify Code Guardian Gives 100% Real Results

This guide helps you verify that Code Guardian provides **authentic, real analysis results** based on actual file content, **not fake or mock data**.

---

## 📋 Quick Verification Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Test ZIP Files

Create three test ZIP files with different scenarios:

#### Test Case 1: JavaScript Project with Vulnerabilities

Create a folder `test-js-project` with these files:

**`index.js`:**
```javascript
// Intentional vulnerabilities for testing
const apiKey = "sk_live_4242424242424242";
const dbPassword = "admin123";

function getUserData(userId) {
  // SQL Injection vulnerability
  const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId;
  return db.query(query);
}

function displayMessage(msg) {
  // XSS vulnerability
  document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = msg;
}

// Eval usage - code injection
function processCommand(cmd) {
  eval(cmd);
}
```

**`package.json`:**
```json
{
  "name": "test-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0",
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
}
```

Zip this folder as `test-js-vulnerabilities.zip`

#### Test Case 2: Python Project

Create a folder `test-python-project` with:

**`app.py`:**
```python
import os
import subprocess

# Hardcoded credentials
API_KEY = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password123@localhost/db"

def execute_command(user_input):
    # Command injection vulnerability
    os.system(f"ls {user_input}")
    
def get_user(user_id):
    # SQL injection vulnerability
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
    return db.execute(query)

# Insecure random
import random
token = random.randint(1000, 9999)
```

**`requirements.txt`:**
```
flask==2.0.1
requests==2.28.0
```

Zip as `test-python-vulnerabilities.zip`

#### Test Case 3: Empty/Invalid ZIP

Create an empty folder and zip it as `test-empty.zip`

## 🔍 Testing Procedure

### Test 1: Verify Real Language Detection

1. **Upload:** `test-js-vulnerabilities.zip`
2. **Check Language Detection Section:**
   - ✅ Should detect **JavaScript** as primary language
   - ✅ Confidence should be **high (80%+)** due to .js extension and content
   - ✅ Should show **package.json** was found
   - ✅ Should detect **npm** as package manager
   - ✅ Framework detection may show **Express.js** if patterns match

**Expected Output:**
```
Primary Language: javascript (95% confidence)
All Languages: javascript
Project Type: web
Build Tools: none or webpack/vite if config found
Package Managers: npm
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Language matches actual file extension (.js)
- ✅ Confidence reflects actual keyword/pattern matches
- ✅ No random or fake languages shown

### Test 2: Verify Real Security Issue Detection

Continue with `test-js-vulnerabilities.zip`

1. **Check Security Issues Table:**
   - ✅ Should find **hardcoded API key** (`sk_live_...`)
   - ✅ Should find **hardcoded password** (`admin123`)
   - ✅ Should find **SQL injection** in getUserData function
   - ✅ Should find **XSS vulnerability** in displayMessage
   - ✅ Should find **eval usage** in processCommand

2. **Verify Issue Details:**
   - ✅ **Line numbers** should match actual code lines (e.g., line 2 for apiKey)
   - ✅ **Code snippets** should show actual code from file
   - ✅ **Filenames** should be correct (index.js)
   - ✅ **Severity levels** should make sense (Critical for secrets, High for SQL injection)

**Expected Issues:**
| Issue Type | Severity | Line | File | Verification |
|------------|----------|------|------|--------------|
| Hardcoded API Key | Critical | 2 | index.js | ✅ Real line number |
| Hardcoded Password | High | 3 | index.js | ✅ Real content |
| SQL Injection | High | 7 | index.js | ✅ Actual pattern match |
| XSS Vulnerability | High | 13 | index.js | ✅ innerHTML detected |
| Code Injection (eval) | Critical | 18 | index.js | ✅ eval() found |

**Code Snippet Verification:**
- Each issue should show **3-5 lines** of actual code
- Line numbers should be **consecutive and accurate**
- Code should match exactly what you wrote

### Test 3: Verify Real Metrics

1. **Check Summary Metrics:**
   - ✅ **Total Files:** Should be 2 (index.js, package.json)
   - ✅ **Lines Analyzed:** Should match actual line count (≈20-25 lines)
   - ✅ **Critical Issues:** Should match count of Critical severity issues
   - ✅ **Analysis Time:** Should be reasonable (< 5 seconds)

2. **Check Calculated Scores:**
   - ✅ **Security Score:** Should be LOW (30-50) due to multiple critical issues
   - ✅ **Quality Score:** Should be LOW (40-60) due to vulnerabilities
   - ✅ **Vulnerability Density:** Should calculate as (issues/lines * 1000)

**Example Calculation Verification:**
```
Total Issues: 5
Lines Analyzed: 25
Vulnerability Density = (5 / 25) * 1000 = 200 issues per 1000 lines ✅
```

### Test 4: Verify Python Language Detection

1. **Upload:** `test-python-vulnerabilities.zip`
2. **Check Results:**
   - ✅ Primary Language: **python** (90%+ confidence)
   - ✅ File extension: .py correctly identified
   - ✅ Package Manager: **pip** (from requirements.txt)
   - ✅ Framework: May detect **Flask** from imports

3. **Check Security Issues:**
   - ✅ AWS Access Key detected (line 5)
   - ✅ Database credentials detected (line 6)
   - ✅ Command injection in execute_command
   - ✅ SQL injection in get_user
   - ✅ Insecure random number generation

### Test 5: Verify Error Handling

1. **Upload:** `test-empty.zip`
2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - ✅ Should show error message
   - ✅ Message should say "This ZIP file is empty" or "No source code files found"
   - ✅ Should **NOT** show any fake analysis results
   - ✅ Should **NOT** show mock security issues
