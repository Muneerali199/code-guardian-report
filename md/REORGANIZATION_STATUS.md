# Codebase Reorganization Status

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Created new directory structure
- [x] Moved components to feature-based folders
- [x] Moved services to organized categories
- [x] Created type definitions
- [x] Updated configuration files (tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts)
- [x] Created provider components
- [x] Updated main entry point
- [x] Started fixing import paths

## 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Fixing remaining import path issues (21/100+ files updated)

## ⚠️ Known Issues to Fix
1. Many import paths still need updating to use new locations
2. Some components have circular dependencies
3. Service index exports have conflicts
4. Type definitions need to be imported in components

## 📋 Next Steps
1. Fix all import paths systematically
2. Resolve circular dependencies
3. Update service exports
4. Test build and functionality
5. Clean up any remaining issues

## 🎯 Benefits Already Achieved
- Much better organized file structure
- Clear separation by feature/domain
- Better TypeScript configuration
- Centralized providers
- Type safety improvements

The reorganization structure is solid, we just need to complete the import path updates.
